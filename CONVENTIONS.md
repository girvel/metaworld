- A method's name should be a verb like `make_entity`
- Temporal entity attributes, that exist only to once transmit information between the systems, should start with `will`. For example, `e.will_talk_to`

- For each version there should be a *main* milestone, that is planned before and can not be edited during itself, because it should show progress. Also there can be *secondary* milestone to contain all the issues that appear during it and should be fixed before. Also each *main* milestone should contain a release task.
