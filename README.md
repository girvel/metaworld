# Metaworld

Metaworld is a non-visual novel - an RPG with quest/novel-like text interface. It is done like that because I am writer/programmer and I wanted to focus on what I do best. So what my game lacks in graphics, it makes up in features.

# Features

- Open world
- You can talk to people
- People can talk to you

# What tech is used

- [My own interpretation](https://github.com/girvel/ecs) of ECS pattern
- YAML to configure NPCs and locations
- Python as a scripting language and as a main language
