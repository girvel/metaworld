# The cycle of development

## Milestones

- A cycle starts with **review & design milestone**, during which the issues for main milestone is created

- Next goes the **major** milestone, that is planned before and can not be edited during itself, because it should show progress. It always ends with a **release task**.

- Also there can be a **minor** milestone to contain all the issues that appear during the **major** and should be fixed before its end. 

## Review & design storm procedure

0. Project should be split to discrete **interface layers** on user-developer continuum. F. e. for metaworld these are:

   1. Game UI itself
   2. YAML assets
   3. Game code
   4. ECS Framework
   
   Each of them represent a separate layer of interaction with the product and demands different levels of developing skills. The first layer is closest to a user and the last is closest to a developer.

1. Put all the ideas you have about the next version on the board. Let them sink for some time, then filter & aggregate them to a whole vision.

2. Describe features you want to see in context of different interface layers going from the user's layer to the developer's one.

3. Aggregate features to tasks.
