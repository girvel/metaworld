    - Brian: Excuse me, what do I *think*?
    - Officer Aernerh: You do not have an opinion? The case is rather strange - it is a first murder here since the Second War.
    - Brian: Sorry, it's kind of like the first time an officer asks me what do I *think*.
    - Brian: And people here call it `the Second Invasion`, not `the Second War`.
    - ...
    - Brian: I think...
    - Brian: It doesn't really make sense.
    - ...
    - Brian: She isn't as innocent as we think.
    - Brian: A witch, sir.
    - Brian: She cursed a lumberjack's junk and he murdered her with an axe as an act of revenge.
    - ...
    - Officer Aernerh (laughing): That is a nice theory.

    - Brian: Yes, sir.
    - Brian: Three days ago elderly woman was killed with a strike in the head.
    - Brian: Her name is Illia Pots, she lived on the edge of the village, she is a herb healer.
    - Brian: This is a first murder since the end of the Second War.

    - Brian: It couldn't be an axe, it is too accurate and too deep.

  corpse:
    lines:
    - Brian: Sorry, sir, I wasn't able to move her yet.
    - Officer Aernerh: I do not mean you. Why nobody in town has not stooped to move her body to the proper place?
    - Officer Aernerh: There should be a doctor or a sheriff or someone else who should take care of dead bodies.
    - Brian: There is a sheriff here, but he can't enter the house without permission of the owner.
    - Brian: Usually a relative invites sheriff to move the body, but she had none.
    - Officer Aernerh: So they legally can never enter and move her body?
    - Brian: After a week it is going to smell so badly that a sheriff would have a cause to enter without permission.
    - Brian: Or we can move her closer to the window so it will be possible to see her from outside.
